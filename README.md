# Natural-Language-Processing
The four projects below were all part of the University of Michigan's EECS 595: Intro to Natural Language Processing. The course syllabus can be found above, along with a PDF describing each of the assignments.

## Assignments Overview

All the assignments were in written in Python, but in most cases the use of libraries like scikit-learn and NLTK were restricted and it was required to implement complex functions from scratch.

For each assignment, I've organized my code into well-commented and easily-readable Jupyter notebooks. All the relevant files (including datasets used, .py Python scripts, and .txt result summaries) can be downloaded through each project's .zip file.

## Assignment #1
### 1) Sentence Boundary Detection
-> <b>Major Task</b>: write a Python program SBD.py that detects sentence boundaries in text.

-> <b>Result</b></u>: built a program that predicts if a period (.) is the end of a sentence or not with 99.2% accuracy.

### 2) Collocation Identification
-> <b>Major Task</b>: write a Python program Collocations.py that identifies collocations in text.

-> <b>Result</b>: built a program that implements the chi-square and the pointwise mutual information (PMI) measures of association for the identification of bigram collocations.
