# Natural-Language-Processing
The four projects below were all part of the University of Michigan's EECS 595: Intro to Natural Language Processing. The course syllabus can be found above, along with a PDF describing each of the assignments.

## Assignments Overview

All the assignments were in written in Python, but in most cases the use of libraries like scikit-learn and NLTK were restricted and it was <b>required to implement complex functions from scratch</b>.

For each assignment, I've organized my code into <b>well-commented and easily-readable Jupyter notebooks</b>. Additionally, all the relevant files (including datasets used, .py Python scripts, and .txt result summaries) can be downloaded through each project's .zip file.

## Assignment #1
### 1) Sentence Boundary Detection
* <b>Task</b>: write a Python program SBD.py that detects sentence boundaries in text.

* <b>Result</b>: built a program that predicts if a period (.) is the end of a sentence or not with 99.2% accuracy.

### 2) Collocation Identification
* <b>Task</b>: write a Python program Collocations.py that identifies collocations in text.

* <b>Result</b>: built a program that implements the chi-square and the pointwise mutual information (PMI) measures of association for the identification of bigram collocations.

## Assignment #2
### 1) Language Identification Using Neural Networks
* <b>Task</b>: build a neural network from total scratch (no libraries allowed!) that identifies written language as English, French, or Italian.

* <b>Result</b>: designed a neural network that takes a five character text sequence and predicts the correct language with 97% accuracy.

Explanation of my NN building process:

* I started with pre-processing the train and dev data by running through their contents and storing sentences, five character sequences, and their corresponding language labels into several dictionaries.
* Then, using the alphabet (of length c) that I just generated, I one-hot-encoded the five character sequences into vectors (of length 5c).
* From here, I randomly initialized the neural network weights and proceeded forward propagate through the network layers (input —> hidden —> output). Here, I was careful to shuffle the training data so as to not overfit to any particular language.
* Then, after each run-through, I updated the weights through backpropogation and gradient descent.
* Finally, after 3 epochs I used the updated weights to make language predictions on the test data.

### 2) Hyperparameter Optimization
* <b>Task</b>: using at least five different sets of values for the hyperparameters  d  and  η , train the network on the training data, and see which set of hyperparameters performs best on the dev data.

* <b>Result</b>: found and evaluated the optimal hyperparameters on the test data, performing with 98% accuracy.

## Assignment #3
### 1) Part of Speech Tagging
* <b>Task</b>: write a Python program  Viterbi.py  that implements the Viterbi algorithm for part-of-speech tagging.
* <b>Result</b>: built a program that uses the Treebank dataset to assign words their Penn Treebank tag with 86% accuracy.

## Assignment #4
### 1) Word Sense Disambiguation
* <b>Task</b>: write a Python program  WSD.py  that implements the Naive Bayes algorithm (from total scratch!) for word sense disambiguation.
* <b>Result</b>: built a program that assigns the given target word (i.e. plant, bass, crane, motion, palm, tank) its correct contextual meaning (i.e. plant = factory or living thing) with up to 85% accuracy

### 2) Dialog Act Classification

* <b>Task</b>: write a Python program  DialogAct.py  that helps a dialog system facilitate automated online student advising.
* <b>Result</b>: built a program that trains and evaluates a dialog act classifier in order to help chat bots determine what they should do next (e.g., ask a question, ask for a clarification).
