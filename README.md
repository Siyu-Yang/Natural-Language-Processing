# Natural-Language-Processing
The four projects below were all part of the University of Michigan's graduate-level course -- EECS 595: Intro to Natural Language Processing. For more information on the class, the syllabus can be found above, along with a PDF describing of the assignments.

## Assignment #1 - Sentence Boundary Detection & Collocation Identification
a) Major tasks:
A) Write a Python program SBD.py that detects sentence boundaries in text.
  - Specifically, the program predicts if a period (.) is the end of a sentence or not with 99.2% accuracy.
  - Dataset You will train and test your program on subsets of the Treebank dataset, consisting of documents drawn from various sources, which have been manually tokenized and annotated with sentence boundaries. The datasets (SBD.train and SBD.test) are available from the Files section of the Canvas class webpage.
